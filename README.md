# SNIC
Superpixels and Polygons using Simple Non-Iterative Clustering, Radhakrishna Achanta and Sabine Susstrunk
In this project, we implement Simple Non-iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm which
is an improved version of the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel
segmentation. The algorithm is faster than SLIC, is non-iterative and enforces
connectivity from the start.
